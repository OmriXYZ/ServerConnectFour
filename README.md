# Connect Four Game - ASP.NET Server & .NET WinForms Client

Welcome to the Connect Four Game project! This project consists of a server built using ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and Razor Pages/Web API Core, along with a .NET WinForms client that communicates with the server using Web API core.

## Project Overview

Connect Four is a classic two-player board game in which players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The objective is to be the first to connect four of one's own discs of the same color in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, before the opponent.

This project aims to provide a digital version of the Connect Four game, allowing players to compete against each other through the WinForms client while utilizing the server for game state management and communication.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two separate components: the server and the client.

1. **Server (ASP.NET, Entity Framework, Razor Pages, Web API Core):**

   The server is responsible for managing the game state, processing moves, and facilitating communication with the client.

   - **ConnectFour.Server:** This is the ASP.NET project for the server.
   - **ConnectFour.Server.Data:** This project contains the Entity Framework data models and database context for managing game state.
   - **ConnectFour.Server.Pages:** The Razor Pages for rendering game UI and handling user interactions.
   - **ConnectFour.Server.Api:** The Web API controllers for handling game-related API requests from the client.

2. **Client (.NET WinForms, Entity Framework):**

   The client provides a graphical interface for players to interact with the game.

   - **ConnectFour.Client:** This is the .NET WinForms project for the client.
   - **ConnectFour.Client.Models:** This project contains the Entity Framework data models for representing game state on the client.
   - **ConnectFour.Client.Services:** Contains services for interacting with the server through Entity Framework.

## Getting Started

Before running the project, ensure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed:

- Visual Studio (or Visual Studio Code) with ASP.NET, .NET Core, and WinForms support.
- Entity Framework Core.

To set up and run the project:

1. **Server:**

   - Open the `ConnectFour.Server` project in Visual Studio.
   - Update the database connection string in `appsettings.json` to point to your desired database server.
   - Open the Package Manager Console and run migrations to create the database schema: `Update-Database`.
   - Build and run the server.

2. **Client:**

   - Open the `ConnectFour.Client` project in Visual Studio.
   - Ensure the server endpoint URL in `App.config` matches the server's URL.
   - Open the Package Manager Console and run migrations to create the database schema: `Update-Database`.
   - Build and run the client.

## Game Rules and Interactions

The game follows the standard rules of Connect Four. Players take turns placing discs in one of the columns, and the game continues until a player wins or the board is full (resulting in a draw).

The client communicates with the server to perform moves and retrieve game state updates. The client handles the game logic, ensures valid moves, and broadcasts updates to the server.
